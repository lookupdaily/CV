My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development, choosing to take the lead on new digital products where possible.

I have spent much of my career building and refining websites with brilliant web development teams. Now I am embarking on a new challenge as a software developer, where I can use some of my experience to help build great products myself.

## Skills

#### Tech

JavaScript - Jquery, Jasmine, Webpack, APIs\
Ruby - Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, ActiveRecord\
Git, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL, Travis CI, Heroku, Agile, Test Driven Development

#### Communication(s)

As a creative marketing professional I have honed my expertise in communications, from writing engaging copy for design festival newsletters and social media, commissioning and managing great content to celebrate Waltham Forest's year as the first London Borough of Culture, to internal communications and team management.

#### Process-driven

Whilst at Makers, I have rediscovered my love for a good diagram. Back when I was learning architecture, iterative 'programme' sketches were essential for visualising the journey through a building—and likewise I have found all sorts of diagrams useful for understanding the different parts/or 'objects' of a programme before I start writing any code. I find a methodical approach, good planning and test driven development essential for developing my projects, and look forward to developing these skills throughout my career.

I have been documenting my planning process in my project READMEs. You can find some examples [here](https://github.com/lookupdaily/bank-tech-test) and [here](https://github.com/lookupdaily/chitter-challenge). 

#### User-focused

From architecture, to marketing and now software development, defining audience is key. Reaching a targeted audience, rather than purely numbers through the door, was integral to a successful event for all of our portfolio at Media 10. 

I am also interested in ensuring web products are accessible to wide audiences by integrating accessibility into the development process from the get-go, using semantics and good design practice. 

#### Rapid learner

Whilst at Makers Academy, I have been challenged to learn new languages and frameworks in just a few weeks, striving to become a language agnostic developer.

I have always been adept at learning new skills and absorbing information quickly. From teaching myself design software throughout my architectural education, to picking up new challenges in the workplace. For example, at Media 10 I took on the production of the seminar programmes for Clerkenwell Design Week and 100% Design in addition to my role as Marketing Manager. 

#### Creative

With an architectural education and a background in design events, I have a keen eye for design, and this is something which I am keen to apply in my software career. I am comfortable working with design teams, and with using a suite of design software myself. Whilst learning software development, I have continued to explore the application of CSS and CSS libraries in my projects - so that I can develop my skills across the full stack.

## Interests

- **Architecture:** I still have a keen eye for architecture and love to explore a great building, debate aesthetics, or stroke a bit of concrete.
- **Hiking:** Walking clears the mind and brings clarity to any situation, often with a great view.
- **Travelling:** I love to combine both of the above and explore a new city or country.
