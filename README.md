My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development, choosing to take the lead on new digital products where possible.

I have spent much of my career building and refining websites with brilliant web development teams. Now I am embarking on a new challenge as a software developer, where I am using some of my experience to help build great products myself.

After completing a software engineering course at Makers Academy, I have been working as a full-stack developer at Cognizant, contributing to Network Rail's transformative Intelligent Infrastructure programme. I enjoy producing clean, test-driven code, and like to spend time perfecting user experience and accessibility.
