My background is in the creative industry, as a marketeer for arts and design events. Increasingly, our events were reliant on our digital platforms, which is where I was able to hone my interest in web development, choosing to take the lead on new digital products where possible.

After completing a software engineering course at Makers Academy, I have been working as a full-stack developer at digital agencies, supporting digital transformation within the public sector. I am now working at dxw, a digital agency creating public services that improve lives.

I enjoy producing clean, test-driven code, and like to spend time perfecting user experience and accessibility.
